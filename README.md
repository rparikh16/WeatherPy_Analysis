# WeatherPy_Analysis

## Purpose
For this analysis, we generated a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes to retreive the nearest city, and perform an API call to OpenWeatherMap. From this city weather data was gathered to determine the best locations for vacation based on weather preferences. 
From this data, an API call to Google Directions API was made to create a travel itinerary that shows the optimal route between four cities chosed from the customer's possible destinations.
